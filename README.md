# nouveau-microservices-go

"New Venture" is our current research or brain storming topic , so we are going to build a new software with cutting edge technology and cloud native.
In this project, I have built backend platform by using microservice architecture with REST APIs where Postgres database is used as persistence data.
CRUD operations/ routes are implemented as middleware "handler". This project is intended to write through Golang.
The APIs have been tested through Postman.


Next step, I'll build front end app with Angular framework. And, later everything will be running in cloud.
